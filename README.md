ExamSeater: Seating & Invigilation Planner 💺This is a Database Management System (DBMS) project designed to manage the scheduling, seating, and invigilation assignments for university examinations. The application provides a web interface to input data, register students for exams, automatically assign seats, and track invigilator duties.FeaturesThe system manages several key entities and provides the following core functionalities:Exams Management: Create and view exam slots, including course code, date, and time.Students & Registration: Add student records and register all existing students for a selected exam (convenience function for demo).Rooms Management: Define examination halls with unique codes, capacity, building, and floor details.Invigilators: Maintain a list of invigilators (name, employee number, department).Seat Assignment: Automated (greedy) seating assignment for a selected exam based on room capacities.Tech StackBackend Framework: Flask (Python)Database: MySQLORM/Database Migration: SQLAlchemy and Flask-MigrateFrontend: HTML (Jinja2 Templates), CSS, JavaScriptSetup and Installation1. Database ConfigurationYou need a running MySQL server.Edit the database connection details in app.py:Python# app.py excerpt
DB_USER = "root"
DB_PASS = ""            # << CHANGE ME if you set a password
DB_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
DB_PORT = 3306
DB_NAME = "dbms"        # << Database name

DATABASE_URI = f"mysql+pymysql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASS}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}?charset=utf8mb4"
Ensure you create the database dbms on your MySQL server.2. Install DependenciesYou will need Python and a package manager (like pip).Bash# Assuming you have Python and pip
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate pymysql
3. Initialize Database Schema & DataRun the commands from the sql.sql file against your newly created dbms database. This will create the necessary tables and populate them with initial sample data (e.g., courses, rooms, students, exams).4. Run the ApplicationExecute the main Flask application file:Bashpython app.py
The application will start, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.Database Schema (Models)The core structure is defined by the following SQLAlchemy models (found in app.py):ModelDescriptionCourseStores course details like course_code and course_title.ExamScheduled exam slots (links to Course).RoomExamination halls/rooms with room_code and capacity.StudentStudent demographic details like roll_no and name.InvigilatorFaculty or staff details for invigilation duty.StudentExamJunction table for student registration to an exam.SeatAssignmentMaps a student to a seat_number in a room_id for an exam_id.InvigilationAssignmentAssigns an Invigilator to a specific Room for an Exam.InvigilatorAvailabilityTracks when an invigilator is available.
